CPT323 Assingment 2         Miles Thomas s3494949

This is an incomplete assingment.  The model is mostly complete, with the 
exception of connections/exits.  My controller is implemented for logins,
command line arguments are implemented in a limited manner.  Game functionality
is NOT implemented, although there is a skeleton of the structure.


program is built using: make all

program is run using ./game --ascii_load data
(where data is the directory containing the data files)

ascii_load is the only element complete through command line arguments.
